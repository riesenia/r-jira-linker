# Privacy Policy for JIRA Issue Linker

*Last updated: July 16, 2025*

## Overview

JIRA Issue Linker ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The Extension operates entirely on your local device and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing data, or usage analytics to any external servers.

## Data Usage

The Extension only accesses and processes:

1. **Current Tab Content**: The Extension scans the active webpage for JIRA issue key patterns (e.g., "ABC-123") to convert them into clickable links. This processing happens entirely on your device.

2. **User Preferences**: The Extension stores your settings (enable/disable extension, show/hide buttons) locally in Chrome's storage to maintain your preferences across browser sessions.

## Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Required to scan the current webpage for JIRA issue keys and inject interactive link functionality. This permission only grants access to the currently active tab when you interact with the Extension.

- **storage**: Required to save your preferences (enable/disable extension, show/hide buttons) locally in Chrome's storage and sync them across your Chrome browsers.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API
- Settings may be synced across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No cookies or tracking mechanisms are used

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

When you click to open a JIRA issue, the Extension opens the corresponding JIRA URL in a new tab. This is a direct navigation to the JIRA website and is not tracked or monitored by the Extension.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no security risks related to data breaches or unauthorized access to your personal information.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the Extension's listing on the Chrome Web Store.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Disable the Extension at any time
- Clear the Extension's stored preferences through Chrome's settings
- Uninstall the Extension to remove all associated data

This privacy policy is effective as of the date stated above and applies to all users of the JIRA Issue Linker Extension.
